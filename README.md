 # MVP-Plugin-Reborn
Remade version of the MVP Plugin written with [Exiled](https://github.com/galaxy119/EXILED)

Simple plugin to show who got the most kills in the game

# Installation
Just download the .dll file release and place it inside the Plugins folder

# Configs
```yaml
m_v_p__plugin__reborn:
  is_enabled: true
  kills_text: '%mvp got %kills kills'
  no_kills_text: No one got any kills
```
# TODO
- Add more config options
- Add PD Decay to 106's kills (not dying from escaping just dying from the damage you constantly get)
